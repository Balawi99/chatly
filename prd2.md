# Phase 2: Project Overview and UI/UX Planning

## 1. Project Concept
Chatly is an AI-powered chat widget that enables website owners to provide real-time, intelligent responses to visitor inquiries. The chat system is similar in design to popular messaging apps but integrates OpenAI’s API for automated responses. Users can also manually reply to messages via a dashboard.

## 2. Features & Value Proposition
- **AI Chatbot:** Automatically responds to user inquiries using a trained knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Base Management:** Users can manually add FAQs or extract content from website crawling and uploaded files.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Each user has isolated data, ensuring privacy and security.
- **Customizable Widget:** Users can modify the chat widget’s design, colors, and branding.
- **Dashboard Analytics:** Insights into chat volume, response times, and chatbot performance.
- **Real-Time Manual Chat:** Admins can take over AI conversations for direct interaction.
- **Seamless Integration:** Simple copy-paste embed code for adding the widget to any website.

## 3. UI/UX Structure
### **3.1. Public Pages**

  - Ability to filter and search conversations.
  - Real-time updates using Socket.IO.
- **Knowledge Base Management:**
  - Users can add and organize FAQ entries.
  - File upload support for PDF/Word extraction.
  - Web scraping option to auto-generate FAQs.
- **Widget Customization Page:**

  - Subscription and billing options (for future expansion).

## 4. Next Steps
The next phase will focus on modifying and customizing the UI to fit Chatly’s requirements, ensuring seamless integration between the chat widget and the dashboard. We will begin by refining the dashboard components and then work on embedding the chat widget properly into external sites.
